+++

The OTCC intends to bring people together from all areas of Open Transport and to provide discussions on topics, that are often neglected by similar events.
Therefore this event is for everyone, who works in Open Transport, either voluntary or commercial, and wants to design and improve existing solutions.


The event was created, as opportunities for exchange with other peoples in the community were limited on other conferences.
