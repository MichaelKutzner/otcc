After discussing the idea several time, the first concrete plans for a community event were started on March 13, 2025.

The participants were highly motivated and we quickly gathered ideas regarding structure and program.
After some discussions the event will go by _Open Transport Community Conference_, for now.
The currently suggested date will be:

**October 17 â€“ 18, 2025**

As the event is intended for people working on open transport professionally and voluntary, we intended a date everyone could participate at.
Therefore the event will be on Friday and Saturday.
We don't intend for a typical conference program, instead the focus should be on learning and exchange.
There also will be some social program and possibilities to present interesting projects.

We are looking for feedback and suggestions.
